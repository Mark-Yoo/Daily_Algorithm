# What happened when you add / delete item to array in Javascript
## Time complex
- It takes O(n) maximum time complexity to add and delete items from array. Items will be pulled and pushed from the where you add and delete if there is any items left from where you add and delete item.
- This is why array is not meant to be used frequently if you are about to add or delete several items from the array.
- It is efficient when you are about to search items from array.
